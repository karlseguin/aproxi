# About
An API-proxying node.js application inspired by hosted services such as [mashery](http://mashery.com/) and [apigee](http://apigee.com/). Built as [connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/) middleware.

This is fairly specific to the <http://mogade.com> and <http://little.io> APIs, but might one day become a more generic solution.
